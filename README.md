# venmurasu
Python code to scrape Venmurasu from its website where its given for free

This code is for personal use only. Its not intended for commercial use.

This code scraps venmurasu.in and creates a text file with the text alone and a html file with all the html tags of the content including the URLs of the images in the book

open venmurasu.in in your browser and copy the name of the novel from the address bar and place it in the code
check how many chapters are there in the book and place the number in the code
check the novel number in the series and place it in the code

change the username in the paths used. I have given the code I casually created for my own use

i have not looped in all the novels in order to prevent the server from blocking and also to not to abuse the server

This code does not scrape the images. It just places the image URL's in the html file and also in a seperate text file so that when u open the html file in a browser, images automatically loads in its place.
